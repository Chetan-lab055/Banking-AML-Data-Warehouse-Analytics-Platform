**One-line (tagline):** Banking AML Data Warehouse & Analytics Platform — a production-minded SQL data warehouse and analytics solution for transaction surveillance and anti-money-laundering (AML).

**Resume / Recruiter-friendly bullets (copy-paste):**
- Designed and implemented a scalable PostgreSQL-based data warehouse (star schema) to support transaction surveillance, alerts, and regulatory reporting.
- Built ETL pipelines, stored procedures, triggers, partitioning and materialized views to ensure high performance and automated alert generation for suspicious activity.
- Demonstrated production-readiness with Docker Compose integration, sample data generation, and advanced analytics queries (window functions, CTEs, OLAP-ready fact/dimension design).

**Short project summary (1–2 sentences for resume):**
Developed a production-ready AML data warehouse using PostgreSQL, implementing ETL, stored procedures, partitioning, and real-time alerting to detect suspicious banking transactions. Included automated sample-data generation, analytics-ready materialized views, and Docker deployment for easy demos and evaluation.
